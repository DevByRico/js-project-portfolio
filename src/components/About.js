      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I’m Ricardo Nicolau, a curious and driven JavaScript developer with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. I build modern, user-focused web applications using tools like React, Node.js, and MongoDB, always with a focus on writing clean, accessible, and scalable code.</p>
      <p>My background in IT support, logistics, and leadership has taught me how to thrive in fast-paced, practical environments. I’m comfortable diving into complex systems, learning quickly, and finding smart solutions to technical challenges—whether it’s debugging code, improving workflows, or supporting a team.</p>
      <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active and exploring new tech. I have a natural aptitude for IT and love analyzing problems to find efficient solutions.</p>
